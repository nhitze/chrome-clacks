To quote the twitter account of the great man himself:
"AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER."
Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black
desert under the endless night.

The Chrome Developer Dashboard sucks and doesn't notify me of feedback - I try
to keep an eye on it but if I don't reply, email me (devpete0@gmail.com). I take
no responsibility for any impact on browser performance as a result of this
extension, though I believe it should be negligible. I use this extension myself
and am completely open to suggestions or improvements.


I don't know anything about licences so I'm including one offered by Github just
in case because it seems pretty reasonable. This is a simple extension and a
tribute to Terry so I'm not really worried what you do with it.


Note 1: There are people complaining about the permissions required. That's fair
enough, I would be too. The latest updates need 'webNavigation' permissions for
reading the HTML meta tags (a feature which a lot of people were asking for).
That is what requires access to web page content. The original permissions
required by older versions were for webRequest, which is necessary for the basic
HTTP header interception. As far as I know, there isn't a better way of doing
it. If you are still concerned I suggest downloading it directly from Github
(link above) so you know exactly what you are getting, you just won't get
automatic updates. I wish there was a way to transparently publish directly from
the public version on Github but as far as I know, the only way is to upload zip
files myself. There is no way I can guarantee I haven't changed anything in
between.
